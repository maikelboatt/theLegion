Head First JavaScript

Chapter 1.  Getting your feet wet =>
This is the first chapter of this book hence contains the fundamentals of javascript which includes
statements, expressions, variables and its values. It also contains some data types such as 
string, integers and booleans. We also learn what coditions are and the while loop. Later on
we look at how to add codes to the pages which entails the console.log().

Chapter 2. Going further =>
We build a battleShip game in this chapter and the codes can be found in the Polaris/Projects/
theLegion/battleShip folder.
We use some inbuilt function such as alert(), prompt(), Math.floor() and the Math.random()

Chapter 3. Getting Functional =>
This chapter is entirely about functions. Firstly it teaches us why functions are important, then
shows us the syntax for creating functions. Also it teaches us how to invoke a function and pass 
arguments to it then how to return something from a function. Then how to trace through a function
with a return statement. Finally it teaches the scope about variables to know whether they are 
global variables or local variables.
